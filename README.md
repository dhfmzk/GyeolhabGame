# GyeolhabGame
> Gyeolhab game in tv show [the Genius game] with UniRx

This game is some kind of UniRx Sample by [Sang Hyeon Kim](https://github.com/rlatkdgus500)  
I want you to study "How to use UniRx" with this project. The techniques used in this sample can be found [here](https://github.com/rlatkdgus500/UniRx-Sample).

## Rule
> Find 3 card set, which has three element with the same or different properties.

1. Random select 9 cards of 27 cards of different `shapes`, `background colors`, and `shapes colors`
2. Pick 3 cards
3. If 3 card's element are all same or different, you get +1 point. (not -> -1 point)
4. If you think you've found it, you get 4 points through the `Gyeol` button. (not -> -4 point)
